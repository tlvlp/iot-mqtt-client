# IoT Server MQTT Client Service

## LEGACY REPOSITORY!
This repository is no longer maintained. See the [project summary page](https://github.com/tlvlp/iot-project-summary) for details and updates.

## Service
Part of the [tlvlp IoT project](https://github.com/tlvlp/iot-project-summary)'s server side microservices.

This Dockerized SpringBoot-based service is responsible for the communication between 
IoT units (via an MQTT broker) and the rest of the services.
- Subscribes to global MQTT topics to accept status updates from units
- Forwards all incoming messages to the API Gateway.
- Sends all outgoing messages to the topics specified in each message.
- Persists all incoming and outgoing message to the database.

## Building and publishing JAR + Docker image
This project is using the [Palantir Docker Gradle plugin](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-docker).
All configuration can be found in the [Gradle build file](build.gradle) file 
and is recommended to be run with the docker/dockerTagsPush task.

## Dockerhub
Repository: [tlvlp/iot-mqtt-client](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/tlvlp/iot-mqtt-client)

## Deployment
- This service is currently designed as **stateless** but still should only have one instance running per Docker Swarm Stack 
since the Mosquitto MQTT broker is not set up to be able to load balance topic subscriptions between multiple clients.
[VerneMQ](https://vernemq.com/) would be a good candidate for that scenario.
- For settings and deployment details see the project's [deployment repository](https://github.com/tlvlp/iot-server-deployment)

## Server-side API
Actual API endpoints are inherited from the project's [deployment repository](https://github.com/tlvlp/iot-server-deployment) via environment variables.
